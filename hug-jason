### About me

Hey I'm Jason, I'm an Oregon based community nut and people connector. Here's a bit about me:
-   Born in Eugene, Oregon - have also lived in West LA. I grew up mainly in small town, Oregon was filmed
- Started out as a .Net software developer, been doing community ever since 2009 (as a moonlight gig at first, went full time in 2011 with Nokia/Microsoft)
-   Husband to an amazing bride and father of three kids, 16, 13 and 11. Our family loves the outdoors including hiking, cycling and exploring Oregon history.
-   Studied Management of Information Systems and Computer Science at Oregon State University.

### Where and How I Work

- I'm a nomad who has an office space in downtown Salem where I share a space with 3 good friends. We play ping pong between calls to bond and let off steam. :)
- I frequent coffee shops and move around, to have different environments and rub shoulders with fellow nomadic workers. 
- I enjoy remote work because it enables me to  spend valuable time with my family during morning drop offs and early afternoons.
- I prefer to do meetings in the morning and have the afternoon hours to hash through my to-do list. 

### How I communicate
- Ya know what - I'm a natural born extrovert so I'm up for communicating any way that's easiest for you. I am always happy to hop on a Zoom call just to hash something out or catch up. 
- If something's urgent - Slack me or text me. My phone number is (503) 507-7733
-   I'm an early bird with kiddos to help get to school. I'm usually working from 5:30-7:00am Pacific and from 8:30am-4:00pm

### What drives you nuts?
- Insincerity
- Lack of human connection
- Quiet days on Slack :)

### What are your quirks?
- I'm big on writing and blogging. I personally manage 3 blogs on various topics and each of my kids have their own blogs. I'm a WordPress geek. :)

### Feedback
- I'm a straight shooter who enjoys receiving feedback, both positive and constructive. 
- I'd rather know how I can get better than be fooled into thinking things are ok if they aren't.
### Support
- I write things down, like habitually and regularly. I'm an avid van of Evernote and it's save me so many times. So please don't be offended if I ask you to repeat yourself or if I'm typing annoyingly during a meeting. :D
- When trying something new, I'll definintely do my best to accomplish the task and learn the new thing - and I'm not afraid to ask for clarification or explanation when I'm stuck.
	- If you see me struggling or getting caught up in a task - feel free to offer help. :D
